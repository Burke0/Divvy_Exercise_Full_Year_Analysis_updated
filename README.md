“In what ways do members and casual riders use Divvy bikes differently?”

Cyclistic bike share wants to increase profits by improving marketing strategies and converting casual riders(people who purchase day passes) into members(people who have yearly memberships). To approach this problem we must take a look at differences in how annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes, what would convince casual riders to convert, and how digital media can help influence them. Key stakeholders include Cyclistic users, Lily Moreno(director of marketing), the marketing analytics team and the executive team.

The two visualizations show that members trips are of short duration but higher frequency overall. Conversely, casual riders take trips that are 40 to 50 minutes longer on average. One possible explanation for this is members may use this service for commuting to work whereas casual riders may be using it for sightseeing and city exploration. Casual Riders may also be trying to get the most out of the time they've paid for.

Here are my suggestions for converting casual riders to members

    Social media campaign to influence more people to use cyclistic for commutes.
    A rollover minutes system for casual riders to sway them into more frequent trips. Meanwhile, heavily incentivize membership with frequent rider rewards and discounts.

Furthermore, survey data could be beneficial as supplemental data to gain better insights on the differences found, and to test the waters with these proposed programs.
